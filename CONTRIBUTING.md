# CONTRIBUTING

In order to contribute to this repository, some few guidelines should be followed.

## When opening issues

Before opening issues, please verify if there's already another issue with a similar subject. Meanwhile, your report could be fixed
by another contributor, so it's also recommended to check the [pull requests](https://github.com/rfns/port/pulls).

### Issue opening model

When opening a new issue, the title must be short though objective.
And the content must provide the following data:

* __Cach√© Version__: What's the version you were using when the error ocurred?
* __Operational System__: Normally Windows, but providing the release is a plus.
* __Problem Description__: Detail your problem.
* __Steps to Reproduce__: How could we reproduce the issue?

However you may open an issue to ask or suggest something exclusively related to the development of this project without the need of
fullfiling the requirements above.

## Contributing as a coder

1. [fork](https://github.com/rfns/port#fork-destination-box) this project.
2. Make a branch, try to avoid using `master` to prevent confusion.
3. Fix or add new features.
5. Test, test and test again.
6. All your tests passed? Then `commit` your change.
7. Update your fork, `git push origin <your-feature-branch>`.
8. Open a new pull [pull request](https://github.com/rfns/port/pulls) for this repo.
7. Standby while your commit is evaluated by the mantainers.
8. When approved, your PR will be merged to the base.
9. Not approved? Uh-oh, something might be missing or breaking the current release. Check the details on your PR.

## Code

* Two spaces.
* English only, though localized documentation is more than welcome.
* New features should preferably be tested with unit tests.
